# CodeGPT Agent with Semantic Router ⚠️

This code is a Python script that implements a chatbot using the [Semantic Router](https://github.com/aurelio-labs/semantic-router) and the CodeGPT chat agent. The chatbot interacts with users and provides responses generated by CodeGPT.

## Prerequisites
Before running this code, make sure you have the following:

- Python installed on your system
- API key and agent ID for CodeGPT. These can be obtained from the CodeGPT platform. Save them in a .env file in the same directory as the script with the following format:
```
CODEGPT_API_KEY=your_codegpt_api_key
CODEGPT_AGENT_ID=your_agent_id
COHERE_API_KEY=yout_cohere_api_key
```
- Install the required dependencies by running:
```pip install -r requirement.txt```

## Usage
To run the code, execute the Python script:

```streamlit run app.py```

Once the script is running, it will listen for user messages and interact with the CodeGPT Agent to generate responses. The conversation history is stored in the message_history variable.
