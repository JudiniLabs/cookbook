# Langchain Agent AI
This code is a Streamlit app that allows users to interact with Langchain Agent AI. It imports necessary libraries such as dotenv, langchain, streamlit, sys, io, re, and os. It also defines a Tool object that contains a ChatOpenAI object with the retrieved API key, API base URL, and agent ID.

The execute_task_prompt variable is a PromptTemplate object that defines a template for executing a task. The LLMChain object is created with the ChatOpenAI object and the execute_task_prompt.

The danigpt_tool variable is a Tool object that contains the LLMChain object and a description of its use. The tools list contains all the tools, and the memory variable is a ConversationBufferWindowMemory object that stores the chat history.

The capture_and_display_output function captures the output of a function and displays it in Streamlit as code. The main function creates a Streamlit app with a form that allows users to enter a question and run the Langchain Agent AI.

To run the app, execute the main() function.
