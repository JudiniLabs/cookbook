        "We are pleased to announce that we have entered the exciting stage of the CodeGPT-DEVS Challenge. Each month, we will launch a challenge for all developers who are interested in creating projects using the innovative technology of CodeGPT.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our goal is to encourage participation and collaboration from the entire community in these projects, and thus be able to formalize our emerging Developer Program. To start, this week we have thought of a small project to warm up.\n",

        "\n",
        "- You must use CodeGPT agents to extract information from the documents, obligatorily.\n",
        "- The input must be the data provided by the task in section 1.\n",
        "- The output must be a CSV.\n",
        "- You can use the libraries you want, as long as they are not used to extract information from the documents.\n",

Python provides a convenient way to develop Telegram bots using the Telegram Bot API and various Python libraries such as python-telegram-bot.Some common use cases for Telegram bots include:1. Chatbot: Creating a conversational bot that can respond to user queries, provide information, or perform actions based on user input.2. Notification bot: Sending automated notifications or alerts to users or groups on Telegram.3. Content delivery: Sharing updates, news, or other content with users on Telegram.4. Data retrieval: Fetching data from external sources or APIs and providing it to users on Telegram.5. Task automation: Automating repetitive tasks or workflows using Telegram as the interface.Python provides a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that make it easy to develop and deploy Telegram bots. The python-telegram-bot library, for example, provides a high-level interface for interacting with the Telegram Bot API and handling incoming messages and updates.Overall, the main goal of a Telegram bot using Python is to enhance the user experience on Telegram by providing automated services, information, or interactive features.\n"
