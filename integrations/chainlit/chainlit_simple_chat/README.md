# CodeGPT Agent with Chainlit

This code is a Python script that implements a chatbot using the Chainlit library and the CodeGPT chat agent. The chatbot interacts with users and provides responses generated by CodeGPT.

## Prerequisites
Before running this code, make sure you have the following:

## Python installed on your system
API key and agent ID for CodeGPT. These can be obtained from the CodeGPT platform. Save them in a .env file in the same directory as the script with the following format:

```
CODEGPT_API_KEY=your_api_key
CODEGPT_AGENT_ID=your_agent_id
```

Install the required dependencies by running:

```pip install -r requirement.txt```

## Usage
To run the code, execute the Python script:

```chainlit run app.py```

Once the script is running, it will listen for user messages and interact with the CodeGPT Agent to generate responses. The conversation history is stored in the message_history variable.
